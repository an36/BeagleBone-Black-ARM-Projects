# BeagleBone Black ARM Assembly Language Projects
This repo contains Abdullah's BeagleBone Black ARM Assembly Language Projects.  

The first Project is a Speech Synthesizer program, written in ARM Assembly Language.  The project contains two parts (tlkr.s & counter.s):

Part 1 (tlkr.s): This program invokes the Speech Synthesizer, when a button is pressed, which will let the Speech Synthesizer speak/say a phrase in Darth Vader voice.

Part 2 (counter.s):  This program invokes the Speech Synthesizer to let it announce the amount of time (in HEX) between the initial button press and the secondary button press.
